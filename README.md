## Dev Notes

This project was a small playground to experiment with different ideas â€” primarily **Next.js** and **SSR**. I also wanted to practice **Zustand**, so the global **mute** is powered by it (arguably overkill for a single toggle, but that was the point of the exercise). In general, I consider sound an essential part of arcade games, so adding SFX felt important.

Things Iâ€™d still like to add:

- Theme switching (light/dark)
- Scorekeeping in each game
- Local leaderboards

Maybe Iâ€™ll circle back and ship these later. I really enjoyed creating this project and hope at least someone on the web has fun messing with it ðŸ˜…
